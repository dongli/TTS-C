Description:

  Trajectory Tracking Scheme (TTS) is used to solve linear advection problem in
atmospheric sciences. It is constructed in fully Lagrangian framework. The main
focus of TTS is to eliminate the spurious numerical diffusion.

  The continuous trace constituents are discretized into finite samples, which
carry the trace quantities (like density, etc). This is refered as Lagrangian
space. By continuously tracking the location of the samples, numerical diffusion
can be ruled out in Lagrangian space.
