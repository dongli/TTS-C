Description:

  Trajectory-Tracking Scheme (TTS) is used to solve linear advection problem in
atmospheric sciences. It is constructed in fully Lagrangian framework. The main
focus of TTS is to eliminate the spurious numerical diffusion.

  The continuous tracer field is discretized as finite samples, which carry the
tracer quantities (like density, etc). By continuously tracking the locations of
the samples, numerical diffusion can be ruled out in Lagrangian space. So the 
control of diffusion is handed over to the user.

  The quantities carried by tracer samples need to be mapped to the grid where 
the result is rendered. Currently, Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation
is adopted for this task. For conserving mass, the old renormalization technique
is recalled.

Current Development:

  - Because renormalization technique will cause overshooting in some cases,
    so more physics-based mapping method should be constructed.
  - Another project "DelaunayAndVoronoi", which construct the Delaunay
    triangulation and Voronoi diagram on the sphere, has been launched.
